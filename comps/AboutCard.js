                Eggsperiments is a winter break experimental project created by myself, William Laurel Alvarez. 
                It is meant as a practice ground for applying my knowledge I've learned during my stay in the Digital Design & Development 
                program at BCIT. I will also be using this project to test technologies outside of school to supplement my learning. 
                The whole premise of the application is to collect eggs and that's basically it. ðŸ¤
